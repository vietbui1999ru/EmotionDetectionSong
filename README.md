# EmotionDetectionSong
Detect the song's general mood. The project is in its early stages of collecting playlist data. Future work consists of extending the prediction to real-time facial recognition using Haar-cascade algorithm and Kaggle's FER 2013 dataset for song-mood recommendation system using Tensorflow, CUDA, and openCV.
